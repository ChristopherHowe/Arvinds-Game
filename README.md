# Arvinds-Game
I created this project as part of my CS 202 class as an honors project. It's pretty laughable to look back at knowing how simple the final product is for how much work I put into this

## Running
If your system is x86 64 bit you should be able to run the game binary directly. Simply run:
```bash
./game
```
Otherwise, you can build the game by changing to the root directory of this repo and running `make` this does require the simple and fast media library (smfl) which can be installed with apt and most other package managers
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libsfml-dev
make
./game
```
